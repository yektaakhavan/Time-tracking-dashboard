## 🚀 My Process

I began by structuring the HTML semantically, styled the layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid, and ensured mobile responsiveness using media queries. I used JavaScript's Fetch API to load activity data dynamically and implemented logic to update the UI based on user-selected timeframes.
